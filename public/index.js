     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
     * `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `conforms`, `constant`, `countBy`, `create`,

     * `difference`, `differenceBy`, `differenceWith`, `drop`, `dropRight`,

     * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`
     * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the
     * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the
     * result of the last `func` invocation.

     * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
     * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function
     * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.

	// is a special Icelandic version of the normal Macintosh Roman encoding.
	// As another example, Inuktitut uses an 8-bit encoding for Canadian Aboriginal
	// Syllables but MacOS had run out of available script codes, so this was
	// done as a (pretty radical) "modification" of Ethiopic.

	/* A TrueType font hinting interpreter.
	*
	* (c) 2017 Axel Kittenberger
	*
	* This interpreter has been implemented according to this documentation:
	* https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM05/Chap5.html
	*
	* According to the documentation F24DOT6 values are used for pixels.
	* That means calculation is 1/64 pixel accurate and uses integer operations.
	* However, Javascript has floating point operations by default and only
	* those are available. One could make a case to simulate the 1/64 accuracy
	* exactly by truncating after every division operation
	* (for example with << 0) to get pixel exactly results as other TrueType
	* implementations. It may make sense since some fonts are pixel optimized
	* by hand using DELTAP instructions. The current implementation doesn't
	* and rather uses full floating point precision.
	*
	* xScale, yScale and rotation is currently ignored.
	*
	* A few non-trivial instructions are missing as I didn't encounter yet
	* a font that used them to test a possible implementation.
	*
	* Some fonts seem to use undocumented features regarding the twilight zone.
	* Only some of them are implemented as they were encountered.
	*
	* The exports.DEBUG statements are removed on the minified distribution file.

	INTERPOLATE:
	============

	Examples of point interpolation.

	The weight of the movement of the reference point gets bigger
	the further the other reference point is away, thus the safest
	option (that is avoiding 0/0 divisions) is to weight the
	original distance of the other point by the sum of both distances.

	If the sum of both distances is 0, then move the point by the
	arithmetic average of the movement of both reference points.

     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit chaining.
     * Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and functions can
     * be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value or may return a
     * primitive value will automatically end the chain returning the unwrapped
     * value. Explicit chaining may be enabled using `_.chain`. The execution of
     * chained methods is lazy, that is, execution is deferred until `_#value`
     * is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut
     * fusion is an optimization strategy which merge iteratee calls; this can help
     * to avoid the creation of intermediate data structures and greatly reduce the
     * number of iteratee executions.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `sort`,
     * `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`, `dropWhile`, `filter`,
     * `first`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `pluck`, `reject`, `rest`, `reverse`,
     * `slice`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, `toArray`,
     * and `where`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `at`, `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`,
     * `callback`, `chain`, `chunk`, `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `constant`,
     * `countBy`, `create`, `curry`, `debounce`, `defaults`, `defaultsDeep`,
     * `defer`, `delay`, `difference`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`,
     * `dropWhile`, `fill`, `filter`, `flatten`, `flattenDeep`, `flow`, `flowRight`,
     * `forEach`, `forEachRight`, `forIn`, `forInRight`, `forOwn`, `forOwnRight`,
     * `functions`, `groupBy`, `indexBy`, `initial`, `intersection`, `invert`,
     * `invoke`, `keys`, `keysIn`, `map`, `mapKeys`, `mapValues`, `matches`,
     * `matchesProperty`, `memoize`, `merge`, `method`, `methodOf`, `mixin`,
     * `modArgs`, `negate`, `omit`, `once`, `pairs`, `partial`, `partialRight`,

     * `pullAt`, `push`, `range`, `rearg`, `reject`, `remove`, `rest`, `restParam`,
     * `reverse`, `set`, `shuffle`, `slice`, `sort`, `sortBy`, `sortByAll`,
     * `sortByOrder`, `splice`, `spread`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`,

     * `valuesIn`, `where`, `without`, `wrap`, `xor`, `zip`, `zipObject`, `zipWith`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that are **not** chainable by default are:
     * `add`, `attempt`, `camelCase`, `capitalize`, `ceil`, `clone`, `cloneDeep`,
     * `deburr`, `endsWith`, `escape`, `escapeRegExp`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`,
     * `findKey`, `findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `findLastKey`, `findWhere`, `first`,

 *
 * Additional options, for internal needs:
 *
 * - `chunkSize` - size of generated data chunks (16K by default)
 * - `raw` (Boolean) - do raw deflate
 * - `gzip` (Boolean) - create gzip wrapper
 * - `to` (String) - if equal to 'string', then result will be "binary string"

 * - `header` (Object) - custom header for gzip
 *   - `text` (Boolean) - true if compressed data believed to be text

 *   - `os` (Number) - operation system code
 *   - `extra` (Array) - array of bytes with extra data (max 65536)
 *   - `name` (String) - file name (binary string)
 *   - `comment` (String) - comment (binary string)
 *   - `hcrc` (Boolean) - true if header crc should be added

 *   See constants. Skipped or `false` means Z_NO_FLUSH, `true` means Z_FINISH.
 *
 * Sends input data to deflate pipe, generating [[Deflate#onData]] calls with
 * new compressed chunks. Returns `true` on success. The last data block must have
 * mode Z_FINISH (or `true`). That will flush internal pending buffers and call
 * [[Deflate#onEnd]]. For interim explicit flushes (without ending the stream) you
 * can use mode Z_SYNC_FLUSH, keeping the compression context.
 *
 * On fail call [[Deflate#onEnd]] with error code and return false.
 *
 * We strongly recommend to use `Uint8Array` on input for best speed (output
 * array format is detected automatically). Also, don't skip last param and always
 * use the same type in your code (boolean or number). That will improve JS speed.
 *
 * For regular `Array`-s make sure all elements are [0..255].
